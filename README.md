# Sandwich-Calculator
Calculates how many unique bread sandwiches can be made from a loaf of bread with n-slices. Cannot calculate past 1007 slices without breaking 


A unique sandwich is defined as follows:
Given that each slice of bread is distinguisable, a sandwich is unique if it has a unique combination of end slices,
and a unique combination of middle slices. A sandwich can be just one slice, or just two slices of bread
